# CNN-only-Numpy
In this repository I will create and train a basic CNN. But I am only going to use Numpy.
The basic CNN is supposed to be able to solve the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats challenge sufficently enough as to demonstrate learning.

For personal training and as a comparisson I will build the same network archtecture using the PyTorch libary.
To compare the simple CNN to a more optimal result I fine tuned a pretrained ResNet model by reseting the last fully connected layer and retraining it on the Dogs vs. Cats data.
